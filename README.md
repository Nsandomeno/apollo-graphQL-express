# apollo-graphQL-express

# Setup

1. Delete the package-lock.json (Sorry!)
2. npm install and check to see if you have the following dependencies in the package.json:

  - apollo-server-express
  - express
  
  if you don't, install them, and start up the server.
 
3. Go to the link that is returned in the console: http://localhost:8000/< your_graphql_path >
- NOTE: I forgot to add the slashes after 'http' in the console long and I am writing the README after the fact.
